# Algorithmic-Fairness-and-Interpretability

## Overview
This repository contains the project work of Group-6 of the M2 year of Data Science & AI for Business, 2024-25. The members of the group are Ameya KULKARNI, Tanmay KALE, Felipe MANSILLA, Khushi VERMA and Qiling Zhu.


## Project Description
The project focuses on exploring algorithmic fairness and interpretability in machine learning models. A detailed problem statement for the project can be found in [Interpretability and Fairness DSB Project Fall 2024](./Interpretability_and_Fairness_DSB_Project_Fall_2024.pdf).

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Algorithmic-Fairness-and-Interpretability.git
cd Algorithmic-Fairness-and-Interpretability
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the jupyter notebook:
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
2. Once the notebook interface opens in your browser, navigate to Code/project.ipynb and open it.

Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Lab for a more advanced interface:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
